# YAML Modules Feature Checklist

This file tracks planned YAML Modules enhancements. Items are grouped by priority and
should be updated as work lands.

## Future

- GitOps templates: inject shared objects into multiple YAML locations during sync.
- Optional mapping file versioning: allow users to ignore `.gitops/mappings/*` in Git.
- Local YAML validation helper: lightweight pre-commit or CLI validator.
- Conflict preview UI: show diffs and choices before applying Sync.
