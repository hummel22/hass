# Home Assistant Blueprints

This directory contains reusable automations that can be imported into your Home Assistant instance
with a single click. Each blueprint below includes a badge that opens the My Home Assistant import
flow. Update the `blueprint_url` in the links if you publish this repository under a different GitHub
organization or branch.

## Auto-lock door after duration

Automatically re-lock a smart lock after it has been left unlocked for a configurable amount of time.
The automation checks a companion door contact sensor before locking and sends notifications for
success, skipped (door open), or failure scenarios.

## CreditWatch notification webhook

Processes webhook payloads from the CreditWatch backend and forwards them to configurable Home
Assistant notify services. Supports per-target overrides so different webhook slugs can alert distinct
recipients.

## Sunrise/Sunset scene control

Turns entities on at sunset (with optional offsets) and off at sunrise. Works with lights, switches,
and fans and allows specifying Â±HH:MM:SS offsets for precise timing.
